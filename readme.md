# A Human Matrix solver
This project aims to solve matrixes in a humanistic way by only using fractions in the last step.
It also uses logic to combine steps together when it can.

# Plans
- [X] Make a matrix class that can perform opperations on a matrix
- [X] Add matrix row opperations into the class
- [X] Make a solve determinant function that can get the determinant of the matrix
- [X] Make a function that solves the matrix and can print the steps
- [X] Make a web page that uses my matrix class and shows its work
- [] Add the ability to read a string of steps produced by the solve function and apply it to another given matrix.
- [] make a web page that can use the generated steps and apply them to another matrix to get things like the inverse or solve for (X,Y,Z)
